   <header> <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB,<date datetime="2012-11-15"> November 15, 2012</date></p></header>

    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited
    about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous
    vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking,
    you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
    plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
    set to the target temperature of the food. In
    his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
    Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
    poaching</q>.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide
    Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve
    a seat at the chef table, contact us before
    November 30.</p>
